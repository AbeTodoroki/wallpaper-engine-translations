[h3]下载 Android 版 Wallpaper Engine[/h3]
我们建议通过官方应用商店安装该应用程序，但是，我们也为更高级的用户提供直接 APK 下载。 在此查看我们的网站以了解所有安装选项：

[h3]将新壁纸添加到 Android[/h3]
从技术和法律的角度来看，从移动设备直接连接到创意工坊是不可能的。 但是，我们构建了一个方便的系统，可让 Wallpaper Engine 的所有者从 Windows 上轻松地将壁纸传输到 Android 设备：

[b]第 1 步：[/b]在 Windows 上的 Wallpaper Engine 中单击新的[b]移动设备[/b]按钮，然后选择[b]连接新设备[/b]。 Wallpaper Engine 将显示 4 位数 PIN，您可以立即使用该 PIN 连接到您的移动设备。

[b]第 2 步：[/b]在您的 Android 设备上打开 Wallpaper Engine，然后单击右下角的[b]添加[/b]按钮。 选择[b]与计算机配对[/b]，此时您的计算机应该会出现在设备列表中。 选择您的计算机，然后输入第 1 步中的 4 位数 PIN。

[b]第 3 步：[/b]您的设备现在应该已连接。 右键单击任何兼容的壁纸，并单击[b]发送到移动设备[/b]，然后从列表中选择您的移动设备。 您的壁纸现在将会传输。

[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26312799/0fc8bc609bd7d959fa87fe7f90e3f1612ba67cd1.gif[/img]

[b]如果您无法连接到 Android：[/b]右键单击任何壁纸并选择[b]发送到移动设备[/b]，然后选择[b]导出 .mpkg[/b]。 You can then transfer the exported mobile package file to your mobile device via cable or by transferring it to your mobile device in another way.

[list][*] [url=https://help.wallpaperengine.io/mobile/pairing.html]Click here to read our Android connection guide.[/url][/list]
[i]Tip: You can also transfer folders or multiple wallpapers at the same time by multi-selecting them by holding the CTRL key. Clicking [b]CTRL + A[/b] in the [b]Installed[/b] tab selects all installed wallpapers and lets you transfer them all at the same time.[/i]

[h2]New Wallpaper Engine Logo[/h2]
Along with the release of the Android version of Wallpaper Engine, we felt it was time to update our logo. The old logo mainly consisted of a computer screen - which does not make much sense on a mobile device. A major release 2.0 release felt like the best time to try something new and we are very happy with the outcome.

[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26312799/1f283ac68453f6bf3beb36c1fd49ebbe680685a0.png[/img]

We have experimented a lot with different designs and settled on a new logo which keeps the spirit of the old design, but with a more modern spin. With Wallpaper Engine 2.0, you will find the new logo throughout the application, in Windows and on our websites:

[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26312799/ecb522ad46fedd9502a715ae38937246172dfcbe.png[/img]

[h2]New Depth Parallax Effect[/h2]
A major new addition to the Wallpaper Engine editor is our new Depth Parallax effect. This effect will allow you to create a perceived 3D depth to your images. On computers, the effect is influenced by the mouse while on Android, the movement of the phone will simulate the mouse movement.

[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26312799/9a593449a484d6a6e55cc8d4293de4dd936f776c.gif[/img]

To make full-use of the effect in the wallpaper editor, we recommend installing our new [b][i]free[/i][/b] [i]Editor Extensions DLC[/i]. We decided to separate this particular editor feature into an optional DLC because the features requires a download which is several gigabytes in size. When first using the effect in the editor, Wallpaper Engine will ask you to install the DLC for you. For more infos, see our full guide on how to install and use the depth parallax effect in the editor:

[list][*][url=https://docs.wallpaperengine.io/scene/parallax/depthparallax.html]Depth Parallax[/url] (Only available in English right now - machine translation works well)[/list]
[b]It's important to note:[/b] You do not need to install the free DLC unless you want to use the effect in the editor yourself - the effect will still work on computers and mobile devices even if the free DLC is not installed.

[h2]Weekday Playlists[/h2]
A popular request that we have received over time was the way to configure one wallpaper per weekday. With this update, we are introducing a new weekday playlist. Simply add up to seven wallpapers to the playlist in the [b]Installed[/b] tab of Wallpaper Engine, then click on [b]Configure[/b] in the playlist section and select the [b]Day of Week[/b] option from there. You will also find the already existing playlist options there, such as the [b]Time of Day[/b] playlist type.

[h2]Windows 11[/h2]
Wallpaper Engine fully supports Windows 11, with this update, we are also adding support for the new rounded corners user interface design. If you are upgrading to Windows 11 and experience any issues with Wallpaper Engine, make sure to do a full re-installation of the latest graphics card drivers. Most Windows 11 users who reached out to us with issues were using outdated graphics card drivers.

If you are using a Windows 11 theme with transparency, you will notice that Wallpaper Engine will be ignored by Windows 11. To fix this issue, simply enable the new [b]Override wallpaper[/b] option in the Wallpaper Engine settings. This will keep your Windows wallpaper in sync with your Wallpaper Engine wallpaper and fix any issues with transparency on Windows 11.

[h2]Frequent Questions About The Android App[/h2]

[h3]How much does the Android app cost?[/h3]
The Android app is free of charge, there are no hidden costs, no in-app purchases and no advertisements. It can also be used as a standalone app without owning Wallpaper Engine on your computer and import compatible wallpaper files from your mobile device.

[h3]Can the Workshop be accessed directly from the Mobile App?[/h3]
No, the Workshop cannot be accessed from mobile devices due to technical and legal restrictions. We built a convenient way to transfer your existing collection of wallpapers from your computer to Android. We tried to make this process as easy and simple as possible, in most cases you just need to make sure your mobile device and your computer are connected to the same network. [url=https://help.wallpaperengine.io/mobile/pairing.html]Click here to learn more.[/url]

Additionally, you can also just directly import any compatible wallpaper files from the files stored on your mobile device. Wallpaper Engine for Android also works well if you are simply looking for a way to turn any video files on your Android phone or tablet into your mobile wallpaper or if you want to use several static wallpapers in a playlist.

[h3]Does Wallpaper Engine drain the battery of my devices?[/h3]
No, we have optimized the app extensively and most modern devices will not notice a negative effect on battery life in day-to-day usage.

We have been using the app for months on our private devices now and on an average day and we have not seen any meaningful battery usage through Wallpaper Engine. The app automatically pauses when another app is full-screened on your device and when your device is turned off. Battery saving mode will automatically pause your live wallpaper to reduce its impact on battery life even further. On top of that, you can also tweak the performance impact in the app settings by adjusting the FPS limit.

[h3]Do wallpapers also play sounds like on Windows?[/h3]
No, all wallpapers are muted on Android. However, audio visualizers work as long as you grant the app the permission to record your device's audio.

[h3]Can I set a wallpaper on my Android lock screen?[/h3]
This depends on your device. Some Android manufacturers do not allow live wallpapers on the lock screen while some others do. If you are not offered the option to set a lock screen wallpaper, then your device manufacturer does not allow it.

[h3]What about Wallpaper Engine on iOS for iPhones and iPads?[/h3]
Unfortunately, Apple's iOS does not support true live wallpapers like Android. It is not possible to create anything similar to Wallpaper Engine on iOS. If Apple ever changes their mind on this, we will likely also follow-up with an iOS version.
